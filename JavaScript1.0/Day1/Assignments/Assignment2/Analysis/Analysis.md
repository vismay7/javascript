1. create a text box for get a date value
2. submit data using onclick function.
3. now my approach should go for month and print according to their vlaue
   4.first i'll check month should be between in 1 to 12.
4. and now check comming month has 31 days or 30 days.
5. if month not belongs to their own days that should be not valid date.
6. i'll go for 2nd month and check that is leap year or not if yes then print valid.
